#### Colour Picker

![Colour Picker](/colour.png)

Colour Picker is an interactive colour picker built using TheColor API. It was built using JavaScript and is hosted on GitHub Pages. I built this project as part of my learning journey on Scrimba. I wanted to learn how to use APIs and this project was a great way to do that.

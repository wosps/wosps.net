#### Tagger for Letterboxd

Tagger for Letterboxd is a Chrome extension that adds a tag search to the Letterboxd website. It was built using JavaScript and is hosted on GitHub Pages. I built this extension to help me tag my movies on Letterboxd more efficiently, without having to open a new tab and search for the genre on iMDB.

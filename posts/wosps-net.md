wosps.net is my personal portfolio website - a place to showcase and write about my projects. It was built using Next.js and hosted on Vercel. The source code is available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/wosps/wosps.net).

**What problem did I set out to fix?**

Whilst GitHub is a great place to store my code, I wanted a place to showcase my projects and write about them - providing more context and information about them. I decided to build this website to do just that and to also learn more about web development.

**How did I build it?**

I built this project using Next.js. I chose Next.js as it is a framework that allows you to build static websites using React. I used two libraries to add a blog-like functionality to the website - [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) and [markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it). Using these, I was able to write my project posts in Markdown and then parse them into HTML. I used CSS Modules to style the website and deployed it on Vercel.

**What was the most challenging part of the project?**

The most challenging part of this project was ensuring the website was responsive and looked good on all screen sizes. I used media queries to adjust how the card components looked on different screen sizes, but decided on a good design for this was difficult.

**What did I learn?**

This was my first Next.js project, so learning about static site generation was a big part of the project. This knowledge has proven very useful and I've since used Next.js to build a few other projects, including [Intruder Rooms](https://intruder.wosps.net). Next.js is a great framework and I was impressed by how easy it was to get started and how many features it has. I learnt about the router and used this to create a dynamic page for each project post, which was very easy to do. 

**What will I do differently next time?**

Whilst I'm happy with how my portfolio looks, I believe there are a few things I could do to make it more eye-catching. I would like to add a few more animations and make the website more interactive. Adding a few more features such as a dark mode and search bar for my projects could also add to the user experience. I built the website without the use of any CSS library or components and I'm curious to see if these may assist in designing a better website.
